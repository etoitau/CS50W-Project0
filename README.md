# Project 0

## Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

### Kyle Chatman

### Short writeup describing the project:
Four pages - index, hover, mario, and egg
- Index briefly describes each page and notes how they satisfy the project requirements. Uses Bootstrap 
    navbar, columns.
- Hover uses CSS to create a field filling the viewport which leaves colorful streaks as mouse passes 
    over. Links to other pages are revealed along top row.
- Mario recreates the first assignment of CS50 by generating a mario pyramid of varying height. Height is 
    controlled by viewport width. This is done entirely using SCSS. Mario has a custom navbar at the top.
- Egg is where you end up if you find and click on an Easter Egg. There is one on each of the other three pages, all        obscured by CSS. Uses Bootstrap navbar, columns, Jumbotron.
